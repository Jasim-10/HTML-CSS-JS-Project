                <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen</b>, born on 15 October 1931 in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, was one of India’s most respected scientists and the 11th President of India. Coming from a humble background, he studied aeronautical engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology. He began his career at DRDO and later joined ISRO, where he led the development of India’s first satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III). Known as the "Missile Man of India," he played a crucial role in developing the Agni and Prithvi missiles and contributed significantly to India’s nuclear tests in 1998 at Pokhran. He became the President of India in 2002 and was widely admired for his humility and vision, especially among students. After his presidency, he continued to inspire youth through teaching and writing books like <em>Wings of Fire</em> and <em>Ignited Minds</em>. Dr. Kalam passed away on 27 July 2015 while delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong. He is remembered as a visionary, a teacher, and a true patriot.
